# COMP598-COVID

Welcome! This folder contains the group project work my teamates and I completed as part of our Comp 598 project (Introduction to Data Science, Professor: Derek Ruths). We achieved a 95% for our final work. 

The pdf file "COMP 598 Final Project - Data Science Project copy.pdf" contains the instructions for the project, as given to us by our professor. In brief, the goal was to annotate and analyze Canadian tweets in order to develop a stronger understanding on the public opinion of COVID-19, particularily in regards to vaccination. This involved, but wasn't limited to, collecting the relevant raw tweets from twitter, cleaning the data, categorizing the tweets and assigning sentiment, and analyzing/discussing the results. The final report can be read in "COVID_in_Canada.pdf", which contains all the relevant background and details about the work completed. 

The "data" folder contains all the necessary raw data that we obtained and then cleaned/annotated throughout the project. The "src" folder contains the python scripts used to complete the various tasks in the project. Lastly, the "tests" folder holds any tests scripts which we would have used (this is empty). 

While all the group members assisted with each aspect of the project, my main contribution was performing the TF-IDF word analysis. I wrote the scripts: "tweet_word_counts.py" and "compute_idf.py" which computed the frequency of words in each category, and then calculated their relative TF-IDF scores. Significantly more details about this is given in the methods section of the final report.
